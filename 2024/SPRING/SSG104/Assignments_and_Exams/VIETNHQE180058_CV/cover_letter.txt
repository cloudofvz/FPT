Dear Sir Michael,

I am excited to apply for the AI Engineer position at NVIDIA Corp. As a highly skilled and results-oriented AI Engineer, I am confident in my ability to develop and implement cutting-edge AI algorithms and models to solve complex problems.

With a degree in Artificial Intelligence from FPT University and experience as a Home Tutor in Math, I have developed exceptional skills in mathematics, Problem Solving, Critical Thinking, Leadership, Time Management, and Data Cleaning and Preprocessing. These skills have allowed me to excel in my previous roles and I am confident that they will enable me to contribute to the success of NVIDIA Corp as an AI Engineer.

I am passionate about programming and coding, and I am always ready to learn and adapt to new technologies. In addition, I hold certificates in Python Basic and Problem Solving from Hackerank, which demonstrate my ability to solve complex problems using AI algorithms and models.

What sets me apart from other candidates is my ability to stay patient and pass on knowledge to others. As a home tutor in math, I have learned how to communicate complex concepts in easy-to-understand language, and I believe this skill will be valuable in collaborating with other team members and stakeholders.

Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the opportunity to bring my skills and expertise to [company] and contribute to the success of the AI team. Please feel free to contact me at hoangziet22@gmail.com or +84-708-118-892 to discuss my application further.
